              <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
                There are a few internal conflicts I face often. One would be <strong>fear of failure.</strong> I am
                usually scared of failing something, whether that be a school assignment or it is a task my parents have
                assigned me. I have found the main cause of this is simply just me wanting to perfect everything.
                Keeping
                things in order is extremely important to me, especially if for example, I am presenting to a big group,
                I
                want to keep everything <em>perfect</em> for the more suitable viewing of everyone. To cope with this, I
                keep reminding myself that if some small things are not perfect then it will not be the end of the
                world.
                If I have a small typo in my presentation then my whole family will not be hunted down and abducted by
                Mr.
                Ibarra (I hope not). That is what keeps me in check but it can 100% be different for other people. You
                have to find your way to cope or you can try mine.

              <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
                That was the #1 internal conflict I have with myself. An external conflict would have to be with
                technology. I love technology and all, but sometimes it just annoys me. I was trying to photocopy a
                document for my dad but the printer was not working. Usually, the printer works fine as long as you keep
                it plugged into the computer. You just open the app and click "Scan" and let it do its magic, though
                this
                time, it decided to not want to work at all so I had to start troubleshooting. I tried reinstalling the
                driver, I tried to use different USB ports, a new cable, and resetting the printer but none of it
                worked.
                In the end, I had to call HP and get the issue resolved by them. It was certainly an inconvenience but I
                get it, technology can be frustrating, and have issues like this all of the time. To manage, I usually
                focus on the things that I will be able to do when I get the issue I am having resolved. That keeps me
                motivated to troubleshoot and continue fixing.
