                A hero for me would be someone who has had a great influence on me and my life. Someone who inspires me
                and drives me to keep working would be my cousin Samdaan. He is currently in a career focused on IT and
                System Management. He works at Enterprise Products with my mom, uncle, and aunt. The things he does on a
                day-to-day basis are the things I am extremely passionate about and love. I aspire to get a career in IT
                or even software/web development.

              <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
                Sometimes I lose motivation to continue my latest project and just want to stop and move on to do
                something else but I just think about what I want to become when I get older and remember that I need
                the
                experience. This keeps me driving and moving on, fixing any and everything wrong with my code.

                I have been talking about this "perfect job" in my aspect and I want to talk about that for a bit. My
                definition of a "perfect job" is the following; working at home OR working at the office but being able
                to
                work alone, working on computers or software so I can do what I love daily, working on a server so that
                I
                can keep my hardware and server-side skills in check, and having a positive work environment.

                I feel like a <strong>HUGE</strong> villain in all of our lives is technology. Now, technology is great.
                It can do things like LASIK eye surgery, control administrative flow in both offices and hospitals and
                so
                much more we can't even begin to imagine. You are probably thinking that if technology is this good,
                then
                why am I saying that it is a villain in our lives? Well, that is because of cyber attacks.
              </p>
              <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
                Cyber attacks are strategized strikes on either a network or a specific user led by an attacker who
                usually plans these events weeks or even months in advance. These attacks can take sensitive information
                like usernames, passwords, authentication keys, digital certificates, etc. Equipped with this
                information,
                attackers can easily log in to your email, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and even your bank account.
              </p>
              <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
                "Well, how does this affect you and me?" Keeping the above in mind we can easily see why we need to keep
                our accounts secure and follow all basic and advanced security measures. I was attacked as well. I as a
                young mind was scrolling on the internet and clicked on a malicious link (probably a 'free games' link)
                and contracted a computer virus. Fortunately, no information was lost, but this was an experience that
                kept me on my toes. I made sure to research cybersecurity and constantly run scans for malware on all of
                my devices. Keeping these safeguards keeps me protected from any attacks in the future. Now, when I got
                attacked, I did not lose any data (as far as I know) and was able to reset all of my passwords just in
                case. However, for others, this might not have been the case. There are millions of reports of cyber
                scams
                over the globe 24/7. Some of the victims don't know better, so they naturally follow the directions the
                scammer tells them to do. Sending money, Bitcoin, gift cards. These are just a few examples. I just
                wanted
                to bring that up. We have to stay safe when online, even if that makes life a <em>little bit</em> more
                difficult, it is all worth it in the end.
