              Where does this story (in my case, life) happen? Where is it
              located? Why right here of course. I was born and raised here,
              in Sugar Land, Texas. I started off my life in an apartment and
              moved to two others before ending up in the lovely home I live
              in to this day. It is also where I made most of my most
              important memories. We are a family of 4, including me, my
              sister (Iyra), my mom (Parveen), and my dad (Imran). My parents
              get a room, I get a room, my sister gets a room, and and we have
              one guest bedroom. Now, where did my parents come from? Well, my
              parents were both born and raised in Pakistan. From there they
              moved here to the US. According to them, it was
              <strong>not</strong> easy. They had to go through not 1, not 2,
              but 4 applications to earn their citizenship and be legal United
              States citizens. I cannot even begin to fathom how much of a
              pain that must have been for them.

              One room in my house I want to talk about is the Office. Here is
              where I pulled all-nighters, worked all day, retaught myself
              lessons, etc. Mostly because of my procrastination but that is
              beside the point. What I am trying to say is that I have
              completed so many projects, so many assignments, and so many
              test reviews that this room has become one of my two sacred
              spaces in the house. In fact, I am writing this, right now in
              the Office. Yeah, sure it is associated with 3+ years of trauma,
              and I have a little bit of PTSD from the scoldings for not
              completing my homework or for late assignments, but it still is
              very near and dear to my heart, and for that reason I felt it
              was required to insert this paragraph.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
              Really quick, notice how I mentioned that the Office was one of
              <strong>two</strong> sacred spaces in the house. The other one
              has to be my room. Yeah, yeah I know. I can already hear you all
              saying "Um, obviously your room is one. Is it not everyone's?
              ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì" And to that I say, no. For me, my room was not a place
              where I could hang out any time. This was the case after the 8th
              grade. Before that, I would only go to my room to sleep, charge
              my phone, and pull all-nighters binge-watching Netflix. It was
              not that I was not allowed to go in, I just did not. I usually
              just stayed downstairs talking to my family, watching TV, or
              something to pass the time. Now, my room (specifically my bed)
              is a spot that I can go to, to rid my mind of worries, relax
              after learning all day, and yes, binge-watch Netflix.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4 mx-4 px-5 fs-5 text-start">
              So you can see that my house is the place where I feel safe and
              where most of my life occurred. I was not a very busy kid, so I
              picked up some hobbies. The most significant (and the only one I
              actually stuck to) was programming. I programmed my first
              website at the age of nine, and I <strong>LOVED</strong> it. I
              could not stop learning about it. That is how we got here. More
              about this later.
